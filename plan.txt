=> goal:
    - traverse the arena
    - get to the end
    - dont hit walls as much as possible
    - best time to win expo

=> provided:
    - width, height (of the whole arena)
    - colour (of line)
    // TODO(anas): find if width of the path constant
    // TODO(anas): find what etc means
    - etc... [*]
=> not provided:
    - arena layout
    // TODO(anas): start and end points given?

=> components:              | N |     | B |
    - arduino mega 2560 R3  |   |     |   |
    - breadboard mini 400   |   |     |   |
    - ultrasonic HC-SR04    | 3 |     |   |
    - ir sensors            |   | [*] |   |
    - wheels 30-mm (d)      | 2 |     |   |
    - battery 12v           |   |     |   |
    - h-bridge              |   |     |   |
    - dc motor              | 2 |     |   |
    - wires                 |   |     |   |

=> layout: [flat]
    > BACK:
        - 2 wheels
        - ir sensor
        - battery [*]
    > MIDDLE:
        // TODO(anas): decide the chasis material
        - chasis made of __
        - components inside
    > FRONT:
        - ultrasonic sensors

=> spin method:
    - wheels move in opposite direction when turning CW/CCW
    - wheelse move in same direction when moving forward

// NOTE(anas):  this is very likely to change depending on what is constant and what isnt
//              if the "tunnel width" is not constant, we can NOT divide the arena into cells
//              so this algorithm would not work
// NOTE(anas):  we can NOT use the right/left-hand hugging algorithm
//              since the walls are not guaranteed to be simply-connected
=> algorithm:
    - divide into cells (width and height known)
    // TODO(anas): when does robot change cells?
    - each cell has a "lifetime" variable
    - each cell has a "bias" variable
    // TODO(anas): when is a cell an intersection? (maybe all cells intersections?)
    => at intersection:
        - take the first unexplored path based on the bias variable
    => if dead end reached:
        - find the nearest smallest lifetime cell with unexplored paths
        - pathfind to the nearest cell (depth-first search?)
        - when reached, take the next unexplored path
    // TODO(anas): how to know when final cell reached?
    // TODO(anas): what to do when final cell reached?

=> meetups:
    - saturdays [01:00 - **:**]
    - mondays   [11:00 - 02:30]

    - formative: [16/01/25]
    - final:     [23/01/25]
    - expo:      [23/01/25]

=> events:
    - order components   [hamza]             | (17/12)
    - start on tinkercad [roya, zena, hamza] | (19/12)
    - start of code      [anas, zena]        | (19~20/12)

=> next meetup TODO:
    - have a look at the arenas available and decide the robot size accordingly
    - start on the code
    - start on the wiring
